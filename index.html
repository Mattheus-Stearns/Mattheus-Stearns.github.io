    <p>
      Welcome to my own website. Here, I host a few files, and pages, about me and what I do. If you are looking for my CV, you can go to that page.
      If you are looking for my project ideas page, which contains some relevant projects that I am currently working on, you can go to that page. If you wanted
      to see completed projects that I have finished, then you can navigate to that page. If, for some reason, you wanted to read my blog,
      then you can navigate to that page. Finally, if you wanted to read about who I am, then stay at this page.

		About Me
	</h1>

	<p>
		I am... only seventeen years old. Shock! Horror! But that doesn't mean that I am just <i>any</i> seventeen year old.
		I have a guiding set of principles that I think would be best to make painfully obvious to anyone who wants to interact with me. Some insight into the inner workings of my mind can be found in
		my blog, but I think that you will appreciate this list. 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I have a deep sense of curiosity.</li>
		<li>I do not think that I am enititled to opinions on any subject that I do not have a profound connection to, and for any subject that I have an opinion on, I deeply comprehend all of the contradictory opinions.</li>
	</ul>
