      Welcome to my own website. Here, I host a few files, and pages, about me and what I do. If you are looking for my CV, you can go to that page.
      If you are looking for my project ideas page, which contains some relevant projects that I am currently working on, you can go to that page. If you wanted
      to see completed projects that I have finished, then you can navigate to that page. If, for some reason, you wanted to read my blog,
      then you can navigate to that page. Finally, if you wanted to read about who I am, then stay at this page.
